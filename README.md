**Introduction**
- Digital screens have become ubiquitous in modern society, with people of all ages spending significant amounts of time using various devices such as computers, smartphones, tablets, and televisions. 
- However, the convenience and utility of digital screens come with potential consequences for eye health. 
- Prolonged exposure to digital screens can lead to a range of ocular discomfort and symptoms collectively known as digital eye strain or computer vision syndrome.
- These symptoms include eye strain, dryness, redness, fatigue, and difficulty focusing. Additionally, the blue light emitted by screens can disrupt sleep patterns and exacerbate eye strain.
- The impact of digital screens on eye health is influenced by various factors, including the duration of screen time, types of activities performed on screens, screen illumination, and distance from the screen. 
- Furthermore, individual characteristics such as age, years of exposure to screens, and blinking frequency can also play a role in determining susceptibility to digital eye strain.
- Understanding the relationship between digital screen usage and eye health is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate potential risks. 
- By analyzing these factors and their interactions, researchers aim to identify patterns and correlations that can inform recommendations for promoting optimal eye health in the digital age.
- This study seeks to explore the multifaceted effects of digital screen usage on eye health and associated symptoms. 
- By examining various factors contributing to digital eye strain, researchers aim to provide insights into preventive measures and interventions to support eye health in an increasingly screen-dependent world.<br />

**Objectives**<br />
- To investigate the impact of digital screen usage on eye health and associated symptoms by analyzing various factors such as age, duration of screen time, online platforms used, nature of activities performed on the screen, screen illumination, years of exposure to screens, daily screen hours, types of devices used, distance from the screen, nighttime usage, blinking frequency, difficulty focusing after screen use, frequency and severity of complaints, observed ocular symptoms, and specific eye examination results.
- To identify patterns and correlations within the dataset to better understand the relationship between digital screen usage and ocular health outcomes.
- To explore potential risk factors associated with digital eye strain and other ocular symptoms arising from prolonged screen exposure.
- To develop strategies and recommendations for maintaining optimal eye health in the digital age based on the findings from the analysis.
- To assess the effectiveness of different classification and prediction models in identifying individuals at risk of developing digital eye strain or other ocular complications due to excessive screen usage.
- To interpret the results of the data analysis and translate them into actionable insights or decisions for promoting eye health and mitigating the adverse effects of digital screen exposure.
- To construct a machine learning model for predicting Schirmer's Test Results for both eyes, considering the presence or absence of anesthesia. The Schirmer's test assesses tear production and can indicate whether the eyes are dry or watery. The objective is to predict the test outcomes for both eyes based on the dataset information.<br />
**Conclusion**<br />
- In conclusion, the digital eye strain project has provided valuable insights into the factors influencing eye health in the digital age through comprehensive exploratory data analysis and machine learning modeling.
